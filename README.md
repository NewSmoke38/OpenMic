# 🎤 OpenMic

Welcome to **OpenMic** — a modern message board where anyone can share their thoughts, connect, and be heard. Built with love, learning, and a passion for open expression.



## 🌟 Why I Made This

This is a cool project which was always in my mind but i could somehow just never make it lol. Actually this project belongs to my first ever workshop series of development of backend and deployment of full-stack websites, which i organized in Hack Club's Athena Award, to teach some really cool under the hood stuff !!!! 

I am proud of it. very much. <3

OpenMic is my take on a friendly, welcoming, and modern message board for all. also cutesy vibes hehe.

## 🛠️ How I Made It

- **Frontend:** its just normal HTML, CSS and JS, deployed on Vercel (i was in a hurry for the workshop to happen so made the whole frontend w AI)

- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + MongoDB (Atlas), deployed on Render (this is my art, which i taught to some cool kidssss, yayyy)

 **Features:**

  - Anonymous posting (no login required!) hehe!
  - User registration & login (this is the auth which i taught basically!)
  - Like/unlike system (login required)
  - Edit/delete your own messages
  - beautiful UI with dark mode
  - Real-time updates (fetches latest messages)
  - CORS, security, and production-ready deployment

i am keeping this project really very basic and simple as i'll be teaching deployment of this project to newbies so it must stay easy for em to understand!

## 🚀 What I Learned

i leanred how to plan a workshop, designed a presentation myself which took a lot of brainstorming cause ykik. while makig it i leanred some deep stuff on which i did not give heed earlier.

i learned how to teach!
actually i had never taught like this so i was just realising how i skim through stuff now as i am familiar w backend now but newbies find it really hard to get it the first time!

and then i felt amazing that some people now know backend from my eyes!!!!!



## 🧗 Common Struggles (i get these often)

- **CORS errors:** Had to carefully configure CORS to allow Vercel and localhost, but block unwanted origins

- **Environment variables:** Managing secrets and API URLs for both local and cloud deployments

# Fun-Fact 
in this project i got no deployment issues cause i used my own deploymnt guide lol, for my upcoming deployment workshop of this series.
